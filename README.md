# Dimensional reduction on CelebA dataset &amp;&amp; Reconstruct Images using PCA

We apply PCA on CelebA dataset. In order to save time, we only apply PCA to 2000 images with the smaller size (219*178*3) instead of all full images in the dataset. Here is the line chart of  decay of the singular values (The chart only use the largest 20 of them):
